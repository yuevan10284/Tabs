Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

On 5.2 you make a pretty good case for a component-based architecture, but
what would the components be?  It might not be a bad idea if you are going
to expand to a 4X4 or 3D or different game setup, but for a regular 3x3
version it's a bit of overkill, IMHO.  Monolithic should be fine here.

Nice work on the diagrams, too.

Nice job overall ~ keep it up!
