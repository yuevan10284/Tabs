TABS project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Nice work on the document.  The description is at high enough level to
   give the reader an overview, and yet low enough level to let the reader
   know what some of the planned activities will be as well as some of the
   technologies that are that you are using, and what they will be used for.

   The justification section is also well done, specifying the MVP focus
   for the initial project goal as well as anecdotal evidence that others
   think it's an interesting idea.  Your self-reflection is evident in the
   way you express that the project is well-balanced and that you possess
   the required experience.

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Good job on the presentation!  The slides look nice and have your usual
   humor infused in them.  I like the graphics of panic and 'kalm'...

   You did well with dividing up the presentation so everyone got a turn.
   You also did well talking to the audience, not the slides.  A couple of
   your slides have a little too much information ~ try for fewer bullets so
   that you are talking more.  If the audience misses something, they will
   ask you!

   Well done overall.

=============================================================================
your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
