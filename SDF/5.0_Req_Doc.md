# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document

## 5.1 Requirements Introduction

The "TABS" system is envisioned as a cross-platform mobile application that streamlines the process of splitting expenses among friends. 
Leveraging React Native and Tesseract camera libraries, this application enables users to capture receipts, perform optical character recognition (OCR), 
and allocate expenses seamlessly. This document serves as a comprehensive guide, delineating functional requirements, performance criteria, 
and essential environmental considerations.

## 5.2 Functional Requirements

### 5.2.1 Camera and Text Recognition
The Camera and Text Recognition module is crucial for extracting information from receipts accurately. 

#### 5.2.1.1 Image Capture
The system shall provide a camera interface with features such as a capture button, or upload image section to manually upload image files. 

#### 5.2.1.2 Text Recognition
The OCR module shall employ Tesseract.js for accurate and efficient text recognition, supporting various languages and font types commonly found on receipts.

#### 5.2.1.3 Text Review
To enhance user confidence, the application shall allow users to review and edit the recognized text before proceeding to the allocation phase. For example, if a user adds a handwritten tip, the computer may not be able to identify this text. In this case the program shall prompt the user to enter the proper tip amount.

### 5.2.2 Allocation
The Allocation module empowers users to distribute expenses intelligently. 

#### 5.2.2.1 Drag and Drop Functionality
The system shall implement a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface, enabling users to effortlessly allocate individual items from a receipt to different users.

#### 5.2.2.2 Summary Display
Users shall have access to a clear and concise summary, providing a breakdown of expenses allocated to each user. This summary shall dynamically update as users make changes.

### 5.2.3 User Interface
An intuitive and visually appealing User Interface is paramount for a positive user experience.

#### 5.2.3.1 Navigation
The application shall feature an intuitive navigation system, allowing users to seamlessly transition between the Home, Camera, and Allocation pages. There will also be a simple profile page were you can manage limited profie options.

#### 5.2.3.2 Intuitive Design
The User Interface shall embody a design that prioritizes user intuitiveness, employing visual cues and responsive components for an enjoyable experience.

#### 5.2.3.3 Accessibility
To ensure inclusivity, the UI shall comply with accessibility standards, providing features such as text-to-speech support and high contrast themes.

## 5.3 Performance Requirements

### 5.3.1 OCR Processing Time
Efficiency in OCR processing is vital for user satisfaction.

#### 5.3.1.1 Recognition Speed
The OCR module shall process and recognize text from captured images within a maximum duration of 5 seconds, ensuring a swift user experience.

### 5.3.2 Allocation Response Time
Responsiveness in the Allocation module contributes to a seamless user interaction.

#### 5.3.2.1 User Action Response
The system shall respond to user actions within the Allocation module, such as dragging and dropping items, in under 1 second, maintaining a fluid and responsive interface.

### 5.3.3 Offline Capability
To accommodate users in areas with limited internet connectivity, the application shall support limited functionality offline, with data synchronization occurring when a stable connection is reestablished.

## 5.4 Environment Requirements

### 5.4.1 Development Environment Requirements
A development environment is essential for efficient project development. We will be using VSCODE and 
making software in two parts, the UI/UX app, and the functional backend scanning and parsing.

#### 5.4.1.1 Node.js and npm
The development environment shall include Node.js and npm to manage project dependencies and facilitate React Native development.

#### 5.4.1.2 React Native
The system shall be developed using React Native, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and a consistent user experience across iOS and Android devices.

#### 5.4.1.3 Tesseract.js Integration
The OCR functionality shall be implemented using Tesseract.js, requiring integration within the development environment.

### 5.4.2 Execution Environment Requirements
The execution environment encompasses the conditions necessary for the application to run seamlessly on end-user devices.

#### 5.4.2.1 Platform Compatibility
The application shall be compatible with both iOS and Android platforms, ensuring a broad user reach. This shall be done via react.

#### 5.4.2.2 Internet Connection
A stable internet connection is essential for OCR functionality and real-time data synchronization.

#### 5.4.2.3 Device Specifications
The application shall operate efficiently on standard smartphones, providing a smooth user experience without excessive resource consumption. If this is deployed on the store, the user will have to have a modern iphone or android on the most recent OS software.

## 5.5 Security Requirements

### 5.5.1 User Authentication
To safeguard user data and allocations, the system shall implement secure user authentication mechanisms, such as password protection and biometric authentication where applicable.
This program will potentially utilize a google firebase login to streamline this process and make it more secure than we are able to do solo.

### 5.5.2 Data Encryption
Sensitive user data, including receipt images and allocation details, shall be encrypted during transmission and storage to prevent unauthorized access.
At the very least, the user data will be stored in a secure cloud environment like firebase.

### 5.5.3 Access Controls
The system shall implement access controls to restrict unauthorized users from viewing or modifying expense allocations, ensuring data integrity.

## 5.6 User Training Requirements

### 5.6.1 Onboarding Process
The application shall provide a user-friendly onboarding process to familiarize users with key features and functionalities.

### 5.6.2 In-App Guidance
To facilitate user understanding, the application shall include in-app guidance features, such as tooltips and informational pop-ups, explaining key functionalities.

## 5.7 Testing Requirements

### 5.7.1 Functional Testing
A comprehensive functional testing plan shall be devised and executed to ensure that all specified functionalities meet the requirements. This will include
testing multiple receipts to see if it is able to scan the text and store it in a text file. The next test will be checking if
our program can correctly sparse the data and store it in an object as intended. 

There will need to be lengthy UI/UX testing to make sure every button/scroll/dropdown/sign in/ and camera feature works as intended.

### 5.7.2 Performance Testing
Performance testing shall be conducted to validate the system's responsiveness, particularly in OCR processing and user interaction within the Allocation module.

### 5.7.3 Security Testing
Thorough security testing shall be performed to identify and address vulnerabilities, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user data.

## Conclusion

This Software Requirements Specification document serves as a detailed blueprint for the "TABS" system, encompassing functional, performance, security, training, and testing requirements. It provides a clear roadmap for development, ensuring that the final product aligns with user expectations and project objectives.
