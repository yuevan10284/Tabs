### Section 1: Verbal Description of the Project 

Our project revolves around the development of a cutting-edge mobile application designed for both iOS and Android platforms. Developed using React, CSS, and HTML, the app aims to simplify the process of splitting bills among friends or colleagues. 
The primary functionality involves utilizing the phone's camera to scan receipts, extracting individual items from the receipt, and facilitating an intuitive drag-and-drop mechanism for users to allocate expenses among themselves.

In comparing our application to existing software programs, our solution stands out for its user-friendly interface and efficient receipt parsing capabilities. 
The key features include seamless receipt scanning, real-time item recognition using Google's camera recognition APIs or libraries, and a drag-and-drop interface for effortless bill splitting. 
The application is designed to be easily maintained, ensuring a smooth user experience over time.

The end user of our application is anyone who shares expenses with others, whether it be friends splitting a restaurant bill or colleagues dividing shared expenses on a business trip. The application's adaptability and simplicity make it suitable for various scenarios.

### Section 2: Justification of the Project 

This project aligns with the objectives of our class and provides a valuable opportunity to apply and extend the knowledge gained in other courses. By leveraging our skills in React, CSS, and HTML,
we aim to tackle a real-world problem and streamline the bill-splitting process.

The technical difficulty of the project is well-balanced, offering a challenge without being overly complex. The one-semester timeline is reasonable for developing a functional and polished application. 
We possess the necessary tools and skills, including familiarity with Google's camera recognition APIs and other payment APIs, to successfully complete this project.

Beyond meeting academic criteria, the project is personally interesting to our team, as it addresses a common pain point in social and professional settings. Moreover, the innovative use of newer machine-learning technology, 
such as camera recognition and payment APIs, adds an exciting dimension to the project, making it engaging for both our peers and the instructor.

We hope that this project is the perfect demonstration of not only the material we learn at LMU but also our more individualized skills including machine learning, AI, and mobile/webdev.
