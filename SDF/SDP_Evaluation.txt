Software Development Plan Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- General Comments
   Very good work on this document!  The introduction is very complete and
   the explanations are good throughout.

-- Introduction Section
   Perfect.  No further comments and no adjustments needed.

-- Project Resources Section
   Perfect.  No further comments and no adjustments needed.

-- Project Organization Section
   Perfect.  No further comments and no adjustments needed.

-- Project Schedule Section
   The schedule section is listed as "Gantt Chart" but you have done a PERT
   chart.  The chart and schedule all look good, but it's misleading to have
   the section name be something that isn't there.  You should change that
   section name to reflect its content.

   That's the only thing you need to do; full credit in spite of the 'nit'.

=============================================================================
your score:  10% out of 10% which is an A-plus

You are good to go.  Full credit for both the first and second submission
as long as you make that one minor change.
