Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   Good introduction to the project.  Description and applicability are just
   at the right level.

-- Functional Requirements
   Make sure that each requirement is a *single* requirement.  Whenever you
   see the word "and", it is likely a place to split that requirement into
   TWO requirements at least, sometimes more.  For example:

   #### 5.2.1.1 Image Capture
   The system shall provide a camera interface with features such as a capture
   button, or upload image section to manually upload image files.

   ... should become ...

   #### Image Capture
   5.2.1.1  The system shall provide a camera interface with features to
            facilitate its use with images.
   5.2.1.2  The system shall provide a capture button to capture images.
   5.2.1.3  The system shall provide the ability to upload image files.

   Also, be sure that you only have one sentence in each requirement.  If
   you need two or three sentences [or more] the extra sentences belong in
   a 'will' or a 'should' statement.  For example:

   #### 5.2.1.3 Text Review
   To enhance user confidence, the application shall allow users to review
   and edit the recognized text before proceeding to the allocation phase.
   For example, if a user adds a handwritten tip, the computer may not be
   able to identify this text. In this case the program shall prompt the
   user to enter the proper tip amount.

   ... should become ...

   #### Text Review
   5.2.1.3  To enhance user confidence, the application shall allow users to
            review the recognized text before proceeding to the allocation
            phase.
   5.2.1.4  To enhance user confidence, the application shall allow users to
            edit the recognized text before proceeding to the allocation
            phase.
            For example, if a user adds a handwritten tip which the computer
            may not identify, the application will prompt the user to enter
            the proper tip amount.


-- Performance Requirements
   These are all good, just make sure that the language you use contains the
   "shall" word, and isn't just a statement of fact.

-- Environment Requirements
   These are fine, too.  Nothing to add other than the formatting as noted
   above.

=============================================================================
your score:  9% out of 10% which is an A-minus

All in all, not a bad first effort, you just need to fill in more specifics.

You don't need sections 5.5, 5.6, or 5.7.  The conclusion text should be in
the introduction so you can just cut-and-paste it there.

Generally, requirements should have the numbers associated with the statement
and don't need a separate header for each requirement as you have here.  See
my revision example above.

Make the changes as suggested above, including many more requirements for
the second submission and you'll get the full 10% on this document.
